# COMP220-TermProject
COMP 220 Data structures and Algorithms

Project Scenario:
We "work" at a live streaming radio startup website that currently operates entirely with a manual DJ choosing tracks to play.  Realizing our team has the best back-end development skills, our project manager has asked us to write an interactive program that can maintain information about the library of music we currently have the authorization to play, and to produce playlists for automated running during long periods of time when a human DJ is not available.

Collaborators:
-Kurt Burdick
-Wyatt Vigilante
-Robert Melikyan
